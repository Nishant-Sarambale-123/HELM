Hereâ€™s a **detailed breakdown** of **Helm Installation & Setup (Step 2 in the roadmap)** ðŸ‘‡

---

## ðŸ”¹ Helm Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Helm CLI

Helm is a CLI tool, so first install it on your system.

**Linux (via script):**

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

**Linux (via apt on Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install helm
```

**Windows (Chocolatey):**

```powershell
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

ðŸ‘‰ Verify installation:

```bash
helm version
```

You should see something like:
`version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.x.x", ...}`

---

### 2. Add Official Helm Repo

Helm charts are stored in repositories (similar to package repos like APT/Yum).

Add the official **Helm stable repo**:

```bash
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
```

Update repositories to fetch latest charts:

```bash
helm repo update
```

ðŸ‘‰ Check repos added:

```bash
helm repo list
```

---

### 3. Search Charts

You can search charts in two ways:

**Search in Helm Hub (public charts):**

```bash
helm search hub nginx
```

**Search in local added repos:**

```bash
helm search repo mysql
```

---

### 4. Install a Sample Chart

Pick a chart and install it into your Kubernetes cluster.

**Example â€“ Install NGINX Ingress:**

```bash
helm install my-nginx stable/nginx-ingress
```

**Example â€“ Install MySQL:**

```bash
helm install my-mysql stable/mysql
```

ðŸ‘‰ Verify Helm release:

```bash
helm list
```

ðŸ‘‰ Check Kubernetes resources created:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

---

### 5. Uninstall Chart

If you want to remove the release:

```bash
helm uninstall my-nginx
```

---

âœ… At this stage, youâ€™ll have Helm installed, repos added, and sample charts deployed successfully.

Would you like me to also give you **step-by-step lab practice tasks** (like an exercise list) so you can try Helm installation hands-on?
