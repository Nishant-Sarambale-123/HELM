# 🚀 Helm Learning Roadmap – Basics & Fundamentals (Detailed Notes)

---

## 1. 🔹 What is Helm? Why use it in Kubernetes?

**Definition:**
Helm is a **package manager for Kubernetes** (like `apt` for Ubuntu or `yum` for RHEL). It helps you package, configure, and deploy Kubernetes applications easily.

**Why use Helm?**

* Kubernetes applications often require multiple YAML files (Deployments, Services, Ingress, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.). Managing these manually is error-prone.
* Helm provides **templating** and **parameterization** → reusability & consistency.
* Simplifies **release management**: install, upgrade, rollback, and delete apps with a single command.
* Version-controlled, sharable, and reusable through **Helm charts**.

👉 Example: Instead of applying 10 YAML files manually, you run:

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx
```

and everything (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Ingress, PVCs, etc.) is deployed.

---

## 2. 🔹 Difference: `kubectl apply` YAMLs vs Helm Charts

| Feature                 | `kubectl apply`                    | Helm Charts                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployment**          | Apply raw YAML manifests directly. | Use packaged, parameterized templates (charts).                 |
| **Reusability**         | Static, repetitive YAML files.     | Templated YAMLs with `values.yaml` for customization.           |
| **Complexity Handling** | Manual editing of multiple YAMLs.  | One chart can manage complex multi-resource apps.               |
| **Versioning**          | Limited – no built-in rollback.    | Supports versioning, rollback, and upgrades.                    |
| **Sharing**             | Manual copy/paste of YAMLs.        | Can publish & pull charts from repositories.                    |
| **Release Management**  | No concept of releases.            | Tracks releases → `helm list`, `helm history`, `helm rollback`. |

👉 In short: **kubectl = raw YAML**; **Helm = packaged, version-controlled, reusable solution**.

## 3. 🔹 Helm Architecture

### 🖥️ Helm CLI

* Command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes.
* Used for installing, upgrading, rollback, searching, and managing charts.
* Talks to Kubernetes API directly (in Helm v3).

### ⚙️ Tiller (Helm v2 – Deprecated)

* In Helm v2, **Tiller** (a server-side component) ran inside the cluster.
* Responsible for managing releases and talking to Kubernetes API.
* **Problems:** security risks (cluster-wide access), complexity.
* Removed in Helm v3.

### ✅ Helm v3 (Current)

* No Tiller. Helm CLI directly communicates with the Kubernetes API using kubeconfig.
* **Security improved**: Uses Kubernetes RBAC.
* Simplified architecture → more secure & reliable.

---

## 4. 🔹 Helm Terminology

* **Chart** 📦

  * A packaged set of Kubernetes YAML manifests + templates.
  * Includes `templates/`, `values.yaml`, `Chart.yaml`.
  * Example: `nginx-chart` defines how Nginx should be deployed.

* **Release** 🚀

  * A **deployed instance of a chart** in a Kubernetes cluster.
  * Example: If you install `nginx-chart` twice with different names (`nginx1`, `nginx2`), you get **two releases** of the same chart.

* **Repository** 📂

  * A central location for storing and sharing Helm charts.
  * Works like Docker Hub but for Helm.
  * Example: [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/) has public charts (NGINX, MySQL, Prometheus, etc.).

---

✅ With these fundamentals clear, the next steps in the roadmap should cover:

* Chart structure (values.yaml, templates, helpers).
* Helm commands (`install`, `upgrade`, `rollback`, `list`).
* Values overriding & templating (`--set`, custom `values.yaml`).
* Creating custom charts.
* Advanced topics: hooks, dependencies, Helmfile, GitOps with ArgoCD.

# 📝 Helm Interview Questions & Answers

---

## 1. **Basics & Fundamentals**

**Q1. What is Helm, and why do we use it in Kubernetes?**
👉 **Answer:**
Helm is a **package manager for Kubernetes** (like `apt` or `yum`). It allows us to define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications using **Helm charts**.

* Simplifies deploying complex apps (multiple YAMLs).
* Provides templating & reusability with `values.yaml`.
* Offers release management (install, upgrade, rollback, delete).

---

**Q2. How is Helm different from using raw YAMLs with `kubectl`?**
👉 **Answer:**

* `kubectl apply`: Static YAMLs, manual updates, no rollback/versioning.
* Helm: Packaged YAMLs (charts), templated with values, supports upgrades & rollbacks, version-controlled, and reusable.

---

**Q3. Explain Helm architecture in v2 vs v3. What happened to Tiller?**
👉 **Answer:**

* **Helm v2:** Used a server-side component called **Tiller**, which talked to the Kubernetes API. Problem: security issues (cluster-wide access).
* **Helm v3:** Removed Tiller. Now Helm CLI directly interacts with Kubernetes API using kubeconfig & RBAC → more secure and simple.

---

**Q4. Define these terms: Chart, Release, Repository.**
👉 **Answer:**

* **Chart** – A packaged set of Kubernetes YAMLs + templates.
* **Release** – A deployed instance of a chart in a cluster.
* **Repository** – A central store for Helm charts (like Docker Hub for images).

---

**Q5. What is the default Helm chart repository?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Earlier: `stable` repo (`https://charts.helm.sh/stable`) – now deprecated.
* Now: [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/) is the central place for official & community charts.

---

## 2. **Chart Structure & Templates**

**Q6. What are the main files inside a Helm chart?**
👉 **Answer:**

* `Chart.yaml` → Metadata (name, version).
* `values.yaml` → Default values (customizable).
* `templates/` → Kubernetes YAML templates.
* `_helpers.tpl` → Helper functions/templates.
* `charts/` → Dependencies.

---

**Q7. How do you pass custom values to a Helm chart?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Using `--set` (inline):

  ```bash
  helm install myapp bitnami/nginx --set replicaCount=3
  ```
* Using a custom values file:

  ```bash
  helm install myapp -f custom-values.yaml bitnami/nginx
  ```

---

**Q8. What is the purpose of `_helpers.tpl` file?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Stores reusable snippets & template functions (like common labels, names).
* Example:

  ```yaml
  {{- define "app.fullname" -}}
  {{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Name }}
  {{- end -}}
  ```

---

**Q9. How does Helm templating work with `{{ .Values }}` and `{{ .Release }}` objects?**
👉 **Answer:**

* `{{ .Values }}` → Refers to parameters from `values.yaml` or overrides.
* `{{ .Release }}` → Metadata about the release (name, namespace, revision).

Example:

```yaml
replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
app: {{ .Release.Name }}
```

---

**Q10. Difference between `values.yaml`, `--set`, and `--values`?**
👉 **Answer:**

* `values.yaml` → Default chart values.
* `--set key=value` → Inline override.
* `--values file.yaml` → Custom values file override.

Priority: `--set` > `--values` > `values.yaml`.

---

## 3. **Helm Commands & Release Management**

**Q11. How do you install a chart from a repository?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx
```

---

**Q12. How do you upgrade an existing Helm release with new values?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm upgrade myapp bitnami/nginx -f new-values.yaml
```

---

**Q13. How do you rollback a release to the previous version?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm rollback myapp 1   # Rollback to revision 1
```

---

**Q14. How do you list all Helm releases in a namespace?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm list -n my-namespace
```

---

**Q15. How can you uninstall a Helm release without deleting PVCs?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Use `--keep-history` (keeps metadata for rollback).
* Add **PVCs in `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` annotation** in templates.

---

## 4. **Repositories & Dependencies**

**Q16. How do you add a new Helm repository?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm repo add myrepo https://charts.myrepo.com
helm repo update
```

---

**Q17. How do you search for charts in repositories?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm search repo nginx
```

---

**Q18. What is `requirements.yaml` (v2) / dependencies in `Chart.yaml` (v3)?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Used to define **chart dependencies**.
* Example: A WordPress chart may depend on a MySQL chart.

---

**Q19. How do you package and share a custom chart?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm package mychart/
helm push mychart-1.0.0.tgz myrepo
```

---

**Q20. How do you fetch a chart without installing it?**
👉 **Answer:**

```bash
helm pull bitnami/nginx --untar
```

---

## 5. **Security & RBAC**

**Q21. What were the security issues with Helm v2 (Tiller)?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Tiller had **cluster-wide access**.
* Anyone with Helm access could modify the cluster.

---

**Q22. How does Helm v3 improve security?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Removed Tiller.
* Uses **kubeconfig + RBAC** → no extra service.

---

**Q23. How do you manage RBAC for Helm in Kubernetes?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Create Roles/ClusterRoles & bind them to the Helm user/service account.
* Helm just uses the user’s RBAC permissions.

---

**Q24. Can Helm install charts in multiple namespaces?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Yes, using `-n namespace` during install:

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx -n test-namespace
```

---

## 6. **Advanced Helm**

**Q25. Explain Helm hooks. When would you use them?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Hooks let you run tasks at certain lifecycle events (`pre-install`, `post-upgrade`, etc.).
* Example: Run a DB migration before upgrading a release.

---

**Q26. What are Helm chart lifecycle hooks like `pre-install`, `post-install`?**
👉 **Answer:**

* `pre-install` → Runs before chart installation.
* `post-install` → Runs after installation.
* `pre-upgrade`, `post-upgrade`, etc.

---

**Q27. How does Helm handle secrets? Any limitations?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Secrets are stored in **Kubernetes Secrets (base64 encoded)**.
* Limitation: Not encrypted → Use external secret managers (Vault, SealedSecrets).

---

**Q28. What are Helm library charts?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Special charts used for reusability.
* They don’t deploy resources but provide shared templates.

---

**Q29. Difference between Helm and Helmfile?**
👉 **Answer:**

* **Helm** → Manages single charts/releases.
* **Helmfile** → A declarative way to manage **multiple Helm releases** across environments.

---

**Q30. How do you test a Helm chart?**
👉 **Answer:**

* `helm lint` → Validate chart structure.
* `helm template` → Render templates locally.
* `helm test` → Run tests defined in `templates/tests/`.

---

## 7. **Scenario-Based Questions**

**Q31. You deployed an app with Helm, but now you want to roll back to an older image. How would you do it?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Check history: `helm history myapp`.
* Rollback: `helm rollback myapp <REVISION>`.

---

**Q32. A chart works in dev but fails in production because of resource limits. How would you debug?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Use `helm template` to see rendered manifests.
* Compare `values.yaml` between environments.
* Check `kubectl describe pod` for resource-related errors.

---

**Q33. You need to deploy the same chart with different values for dev, staging, and prod. How do you manage that?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Maintain separate `values-dev.yaml`, `values-staging.yaml`, `values-prod.yaml`.
* Deploy with:

  ```bash
  helm install myapp -f values-dev.yaml
  ```

---

**Q34. You want to monitor changes in a chart repo and auto-upgrade your cluster. How would you set that up?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Use **ArgoCD / FluxCD (GitOps)** for continuous delivery of Helm charts.
* Or use CI/CD pipelines with `helm upgrade`.

---

**Q35. Your Helm release upgrade failed halfway. What’s your approach to fix it?**
👉 **Answer:**

* Run `helm status myapp` to check logs.
* Rollback: `helm rollback myapp`.
* Debug with `helm template` & `kubectl describe`.
* Fix values & retry upgrade.
