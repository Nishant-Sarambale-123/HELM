Hereâ€™s a **detailed guide for Step 9: Helm Hooks & Lifecycle**, with examples and interview Q\&A:

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Helm Hooks & Lifecycle

Helm hooks allow you to **run Kubernetes resources at specific points in the release lifecycle**. Hooks are useful for jobs that need to run **before or after deployments**, upgrades, or deletions.

---

### 1. **What are Helm Hooks?**

Hooks are **special annotations** in Kubernetes manifests inside a Helm chart that tell Helm to run the resource at a specific lifecycle event.

**Common hook events:**

| Hook Event      | When it Runs                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `pre-install`   | Before the chart is installed |
| `post-install`  | After the chart is installed  |
| `pre-delete`    | Before the chart is deleted   |
| `post-delete`   | After the chart is deleted    |
| `pre-upgrade`   | Before upgrading a release    |
| `post-upgrade`  | After upgrading a release     |
| `pre-rollback`  | Before rolling back a release |
| `post-rollback` | After rolling back a release  |

**Annotation format in manifest:**

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
```

---

### 2. **Example: Run a Job Before Deploying an App**

**File:** `templates/init-job.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-init"
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: init
          image: busybox
          command: ["echo", "Initializing database..."]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

**Explanation:**

* This Job runs **before the main app is deployed**.
* Useful for DB setup, migrations, or pre-requisites.

---

### 3. **Helm Test**

Helm allows you to **test a release** by defining a test Job with the `helm.sh/hook: test` annotation.

**Example:** `templates/test-job.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: "{{ .Release.Name }}-test"
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: curl-test
          image: curlimages/curl
          command: ["curl", "-f", "http://myapp:80"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

**Run the test:**

```bash
helm test myapp
```

* Helm runs the test Job and reports **pass/fail**.
* Useful for smoke tests or health checks.

### âœ… Best Practices for Hooks

1. **Use only when necessary** â€“ avoid overcomplicating charts.
2. **Use `pre-` hooks** for initialization tasks.
3. **Use `post-` hooks** for cleanup or notifications.
4. **Set `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy`** to automatically clean up completed Jobs:

```yaml
annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": test
  "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": hook-succeeded
```

5. Document hook purpose in README.md.

## ðŸ”¹ Helm Hooks â€“ Interview Q\&A

### 1. **Q: What is a Helm hook?**

**A:**
A Helm hook is a Kubernetes resource with a special annotation that runs at a **specific point in the Helm release lifecycle** (install, upgrade, delete, rollback).

---

### 2. **Q: Name some common hook events.**

**A:**

* `pre-install`, `post-install`
* `pre-upgrade`, `post-upgrade`
* `pre-delete`, `post-delete`
* `pre-rollback`, `post-rollback`

---

### 3. **Q: How do you define a Helm hook?**

**A:**
Add an annotation to a resource in `templates/`:

```yaml
annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
```

---

### 4. **Q: Give an example of using a pre-install hook.**

**A:**
A Job that initializes a database before deploying an app:

```yaml
annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
```

---

### 5. **Q: How do you write a Helm test for a release?**

**A:**

* Define a Job with `helm.sh/hook: test`
* Run:

```bash
helm test myapp
```

* Helm reports pass/fail

---

### 6. **Q: How can you automatically clean up test Jobs?**

**A:**
Use `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy` annotation:

```yaml
annotations:
  "helm.sh/hook": test
  "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": hook-succeeded
```

---

### 7. **Q: When should you use hooks in Helm?**

**A:**

* Running initialization tasks before install (`pre-install`)
* Running cleanup tasks after uninstall (`post-delete`)
* Performing smoke tests (`test`)
* Running migrations before upgrade (`pre-upgrade`)

I can also make a **diagram showing Helm lifecycle events + hooks + execution order**â€”itâ€™s very handy for interviews and understanding flow.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
