Perfect 👍 You’re now moving to the **next stage: Using Helm Charts (Step 3 in the roadmap)**.
Here’s a **detailed breakdown with explanations + commands + examples** 👇

---

## 🔹 3. Using Helm Charts

Once Helm is installed and a repo is added, you can **deploy, manage, and rollback applications** using Helm charts.

---

### 1. **helm install – Install a Chart**

Installs an application (chart) into your Kubernetes cluster.

**Syntax:**

```bash
helm install <release-name> <chart-name> [flags]
```

**Example:**

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx
```

* `myapp` → Release name (your chosen name).
* `bitnami/nginx` → Chart from Bitnami repo.

👉 Check running resources:

```bash
kubectl get all
```

---

### 2. **helm upgrade – Upgrade a Release**

Used to apply changes (new chart version or new values).

**Syntax:**

```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-name> -f values.yaml
```

**Example (changing service type to LoadBalancer):**

```bash
helm upgrade myapp bitnami/nginx --set service.type=LoadBalancer
```

👉 This updates the running release without uninstalling.

---

### 3. **helm rollback – Rollback to Previous Version**

If an upgrade fails, rollback to an earlier version.

**Syntax:**

```bash
helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number>
```

**Steps:**

1. First, check history:

   ```bash
   helm history myapp
   ```
2. Rollback:

   ```bash
   helm rollback myapp 1
   ```

👉 This reverts the release back to the chosen revision.

---

### 4. **helm uninstall – Remove a Release**

Deletes the Helm release and associated Kubernetes resources.

**Syntax:**

```bash
helm uninstall <release-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
helm uninstall myapp
```

👉 Removes all resources created by the chart.

---

### 5. **Check Release History**

See revisions (versions) of your Helm release.

```bash
helm history myapp
```

You’ll see:

* Revision numbers
* Date/time
* Chart version
* Status (deployed, superseded, rolled back)

---

### 6. **Helm Release Naming**

If you don’t provide a release name, Helm generates a random one (like *lively-otter* 🦦).

**Examples:**

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx   # release name = myapp
helm install bitnami/nginx         # random release name like "curious-wolf"
```

👉 Best practice: Always give meaningful names (like `frontend`, `backend`, `mysql-db`).

---

✅ By mastering these commands, you can **deploy, upgrade, rollback, and remove** apps in Kubernetes using Helm.

Do you want me to also make a **real-world scenario workflow** (like: deploy app → upgrade config → rollback → uninstall) so you can practice it end-to-end?

Got it 👍
Here are **Interview Questions & Answers on Helm Charts usage (Step 3)** 👇

---

## 🔹 Helm Charts – Interview Q\&A

### 1. **Q: What is a Helm Chart?**

**A:**
A Helm Chart is a package that contains Kubernetes YAML manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) along with templates and default values. It helps in deploying applications consistently across environments.

---

### 2. **Q: How do you install a Helm chart?**

**A:**
Use the `helm install` command.

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx
```

* `myapp` → release name
* `bitnami/nginx` → chart from Bitnami repo

---

### 3. **Q: What is a Helm Release?**

**A:**
A release is a **deployed instance** of a Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster. Multiple releases of the same chart can run with different names and configurations.

---

### 4. **Q: How do you upgrade a Helm release?**

**A:**
Use `helm upgrade`.

```bash
helm upgrade myapp bitnami/nginx --set service.type=LoadBalancer
```

This updates the release without uninstalling.

---

### 5. **Q: What happens if an upgrade fails?**

**A:**
You can rollback to a previous stable revision using `helm rollback`.

```bash
helm rollback myapp 1
```

This reverts release `myapp` to revision `1`.

---

### 6. **Q: How do you check the release history of a Helm deployment?**

**A:**

```bash
helm history myapp
```

This shows revisions, chart version, and status (deployed, superseded, failed, rolled back).

---

### 7. **Q: How do you uninstall a Helm release?**

**A:**

```bash
helm uninstall myapp
```

This removes all resources deployed by that chart.

---

### 8. **Q: What if you don’t provide a release name while installing a chart?**

**A:**
Helm automatically generates a random name (like *shiny-tiger*).
Best practice: always give meaningful names for easier management.

---

### 9. **Q: Can you run multiple releases of the same chart?**

**A:**
Yes ✅. Example:

```bash
helm install frontend bitnami/nginx
helm install backend bitnami/nginx
```

Both use the same chart but with different release names/configurations.

---

### 10. **Q: How do you override default values of a chart?**

**A:**

* Inline:

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx --set service.type=LoadBalancer
```

* Using a custom file:

```bash
helm install myapp bitnami/nginx -f custom-values.yaml
```

⚡ These are **common interview questions for Helm usage**.

👉 Do you also want me to prepare **scenario-based Q\&A** (like real-world troubleshooting with upgrade/rollback, values.yaml conflicts, etc.)?
